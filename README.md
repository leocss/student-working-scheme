Guys, i have added some updates to this, Although fro some reasons, the chart does not come up
If i request for it and i am stil trying to use this css file i got from the net. It has some beautiful effects.
you can see the file in css/style.css.

I have a broken image link and will fix it ltr tonight. Finally, the delete functionality is yet to be implemented.

When you pul;l, install the sql schema via wamp, xamp or lamp as usual.
Then you log in to see how it is

Just added a print functionality so that reports generated can be printed . also thinking of adding an email module but remembered
its jus for a local machine.
